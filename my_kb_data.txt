The Eleven Major Organ Systems of the Human Body.
The body is organized into 11 interconnected organ systems, each performing specific tasks vital for maintaining homeostasis. Understanding these systems is fundamental to human anatomy.

1. Integumentary System: This system includes the **skin, hair, and nails**. Its main function is to form the **external protective covering** of the body, providing insulation, and synthesizing Vitamin D. It acts as the first line of defense against pathogens.
2. Skeletal System: Composed of **bones, cartilage, and ligaments**. It provides the **structural framework** for the body, protects internal organs (like the brain and heart), stores minerals (calcium), and is the site of blood cell formation (hematopoiesis).
3. Muscular System: Includes the **skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles**. Its primary role is **movement** (locomotion, posture, and heat production). It works closely with the skeletal system to move bones.
4. Nervous System: Consists of the **brain, spinal cord, and nerves**. It is the **fast-acting control system** of the body, responding to internal and external stimuli by activating muscles and glands.
5. Endocrine System: Involves **glands** that secrete **hormones** (e.g., pituitary, thyroid, adrenal). It is the **slow-acting control system** that regulates processes like growth, reproduction, and metabolism.
6. Cardiovascular System: Composed of the **heart, blood vessels, and blood**. It is responsible for **transporting oxygen, nutrients, hormones**, and waste products (like carbon dioxide) throughout the body.
7. Lymphatic System (Immune): Includes the **lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, and lymphatic vessels**. It filters blood and lymph fluid and is critical for **defending the body against infection and disease**.
8. Respiratory System: Includes the **lungs, trachea, and bronchi**. Its main function is to **supply the body with oxygen** and remove carbon dioxide through gas exchange.
9. Digestive System: A long tube from the **mouth to the anus** that includes organs like the **stomach, intestines, and liver**. Its purpose is to **break down food** into absorbable nutrients and eliminate indigestible waste.
10. Urinary System: Includes the **kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra**. Its main role is to **eliminate nitrogenous wastes** from the blood and regulate water, electrolyte, and acid-base balance.
11. Reproductive System: Involves the **testes and ovaries**. Its primary function is the **production of offspring** and the secretion of sex hormones.
